# pixelated-candy-crush

This project was done for learning purposes follwing th walkthrough by Ania Kubow. The link to the walkthrough can be found [here](https://youtu.be/XD5sZWxwJUk)!

After finishing the tutorial, I've tested it out (manual test) and found out that the first and last squares are not working as it supposed to be.
Therefore, I've fixed it.

PS. I've also make the pixelted version of the candy! (This project was a great excuse to practice my pixel art skills)
